# Movement-By-Rotation-Example

Very barebones project that shows how to do movement in Godot based on the rotation of a weapon. 

Use A and D to rotate the weapon. Press Space to fly off in the direction of the weapon. 

One example is a kinematic body that will dash for a certain distance and then stop. (or stops when it collides with anything)
The other example is a rigidbody on which impulse is applied in the direction that it's weapon is pointing. 

Hopefully this will be useful to someone.
